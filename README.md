In this lab we are going to create a windows vm and linux vm
---

1. Create a Resource Group 
2. Create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM)
   - While creating the VM, select the previously created Resource Group
   - While creating the VM, allow it to create a new Virtual Network (Vnet) and Subnet
3. Create a Linux (Ubuntu) VM
   - While creating the VM, select the previously created Resource Group and Virtual Networkâ€”the Virtual Network MUST BE THE SAME.
   - Authentication type: Username/Password
4. Ensure both VMs are in the same Virtual Network / Subnet
